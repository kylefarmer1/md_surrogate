# Simple Molucular Dynamics Surrogate Model with Graph Nets

This repository contains a demonstration of learning to simulate a physics process such as molecular dynamics with graph neural networks (GNNs). The model is inspired by and an implementation of a culmination of work out of a group in Deepmind. Their graph_nets library is the core data structure that is used throughout this codebase. A few good resources from their group are:
